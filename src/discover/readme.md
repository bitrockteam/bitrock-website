#### Lean UX
Lean UX is a methodology to allow to design new products/services in a short time. How it works: a team working together in a “war room”; a time boxed agenda with well defined milestones.

* MONDAY: it’s the day dedicated to the analysis
* TUESDAY: starting to schetching
* WEDNESDAY: time to check and  vote the drafts
* THURSDAY: ideas become a prototype
* FRIDAY: testing the  prototype with end users

The target is to get quickly to an initial Minimum Viable Product (MVP), to be tested with End Users. Getting the End Users feedback and adding new features week by week the MVP grows up to a Candidate Release.
