#### Lightbend Reactive Architecture - Professional

![/img/lightbend-logo.png](/img/lightbend-logo.png)
LRA - Professional

Designing Reactive systems and microservices requires architects and teams to think differently about design - taking into account concurrency, messaging and coordination - in order to achieve the promise of resilient and elastic software. As microservices have emerged as the gold standard of developing modern software applications, every team needs to develop a deep understanding of how to design, build and operate software in a Reactive world if they want to remain relevant.

#### Lightbend Akka Streams for Scala - Professional
