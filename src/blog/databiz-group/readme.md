From Databiz to Databiz Group | The foundation of a holding group and the birth of Bitrock in a roadmap of achievements started in 2009.

From this reorganization comes to light **BITROCK**, a **consulting** and **system integration company** committed to offer **avant-garde** and **innovative solutions** in the field of **Microservices**, **Reactive Platform** and **Fast Data technologies**, with the objective to accompany and support companies along the **digital transformation path**.

> * The company had an important growth in the last years and we believe that it is necessary to grow for external lines, as well as internal: we have created a "vehicle" that allows to manage the growth in a strategic way and to finalize mergers and acquisitions in a better way*

**Innovation** and **research** are the core of **BITROCK**. The company aims to provide **reliable innovation** through a completely different paradigm of projectuality, in order to **understand** the real **needs** of the clients and **anticipate trends** and **evolutions**.

Bitrock's value proposition pillars | From business to experience passing through technological innovation

The holding has today about **75 employees**, and in 2017 it reached **7 million** in revenues, aiming to 9 for 2018: the reference markets are **finance**, **insurance**, **Fintech**, **Industrial** and **Media**.

> *We believe that it is time to talk about digital evolution, instead of transformation. In the current world of IT we notice that applications are focused on managing processes, reports and data in an aseptic way: in simple words we might say that computers are used mainly to save and to historicize data. A paradigm must change, allowing a better relationship among companies, customers and end users: we need a change of design approach in the implementation of **new IT applications**. We have to use modern technologies that guarantee **performance**, **reliability** and **scalability**."*
