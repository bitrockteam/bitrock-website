In this three-day hands-on course you will learn how to build an application that can publish data to, and subscribe to data from, an Apache KafkaTM cluster. You will learn the role of Kafka in the modern data distribution pipeline, discuss core Kafka architectural concepts and components, and review the Kafka developer APIs. As well as core Kafka, Kafka Connect, and Kafka Streams, the course also covers other components in the broader Confluent Platform, such as the Schema Registry and the REST Proxy.

This course is designed for application developers, ETL (extract, transform, and load) developers, and data scientists who need to interact with Kafka clusters as a source of, or destination for, data.
