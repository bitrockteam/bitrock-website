This is a relevant step ahead for our Academy; we are now able to deliver exclusive and certified training around **Apache Kafka services**. This type of certification is a good differentiator in the current  job market. **Systems integrators** and other tech players who provide **Kafka services** to other organizations can use the fact that they have Confluent Certified staff to stand out from the competition, and at the same way **Employers** looking for new staff can use the fact that some people are **ConfluentCertified** as a way to quickly identify **high-quality job candidates**.
