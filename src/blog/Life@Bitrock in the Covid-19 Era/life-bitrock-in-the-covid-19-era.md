The Covid-19 health emergency has resulted in an inevitable global shutdown with serious consequences on business, investors, supply chains and human resource functions. What started out as limited business disruption, due to the circumscribed number of cases and geographical areas, has soon begun affecting most – if not all – businesses.

At Bitrock we are doing our best to overcome the hard challenges this troubled time is causing.

Thanks to the expertise of our Team, along with the trusting relationship we have built with partners and collaborators over time, we are able to **keep on working and delivering**, counting on the human and professional value of our employees. Following **smart working best practices**, we are able to work on our ongoing projects staying at home, thus respecting authorities’ guidelines and our community.

During these weeks of unusual working conditions, we have also tried to give the due importance to social relations. Since an office is where we spend most of our daily time surrounded by co-workers, we’ve decided to give our Team the possibility to keep on interacting in our brand-new **Bitrock_VirtualOffice**. A free, shared virtual space where we can make small talk, even if we’re all miles away from our usual workplace.

As we strongly believe in the importance of connections, we have also decided to inaugurate **online teambuilding events**: interactive activities dedicated to a wide array of topics, during which we will have the opportunity to learn new things, have fun and, above all, stay together – even if only virtually speaking.

Effort and dedication are required to everyone during this period. At Bitrock, we are doing our best to meet all client’s expectations and keep on delivering reliable innovation, with due commitment and a resilient attitude.

However challenging circumstances may seem, we’re ready to grow and learn from them.
