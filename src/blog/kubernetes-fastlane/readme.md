When **Google** started running **containers** a decade ago, nobody could reach this kind of infrastructure agility and efficiency. Using this knowledge, Google released **Kubernetes** as a **free** and **open source project**. Nowadays Kubernetes is used by small companies and big enterprises who want to gain the efficiency and velocity Google has.

You can containerize applications using **Docker**. You can then run those containers on your servers, but there's no way you can manage those efficiently without extra management software. **Kubernetes** is an orchestrator for your containers that will **create**, **schedule** and **manage** your containers on a **cluster of servers**. **Kubernetes** can run **on-premise** or **in the cloud**, on a **single machine** or on **thousands of machines**.

Here in **Bitrock** our **DevOps** team created a **dedicated course** that will help you to gain understanding how to deploy, use, and maintain your applications on **Kubernetes**. 

If you are into **DevOps**, this is a technology you need to master. **Kubernetes** has gained a lot of popularity lately and it is a well sought skill by companies.
