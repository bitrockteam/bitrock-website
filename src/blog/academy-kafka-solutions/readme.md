In this **three-day hands-on course** you will learn how to build an application that can publish data to, and subscribe to data from, an **Apache Kafka cluster**.

You will learn the role of Kafka in the modern data distribution pipeline, discuss core Kafka architectural concepts and components, and review the **Kafka** developer **APIs**. As well as core **Kafka**, **Kafka Connect**, and **Kafka Streams**, the course also covers other components in the broader **Confluent Platform**, such as the **Schema Registry** and the **REST Proxy**.

### Hands-On Training

Throughout the course, hands-on exercises reinforce the topics being discussed. Exercises include:

* Using Kafka’s command-line tools
* Writing Consumers and Producers
* Writing a multi-threaded Consumer
* Using the REST Proxy
* Storing Avro data in Kafka with the Schema Registry
* Ingesting data with Kafka Connect

### Who Should Attend?

This course is designed for application developers, ETL (extract, transform, and load) developers, and data scientists who need to interact with Kafka clusters as a source of, or destination for, data.

### Course Prerequisites

Attendees should be familiar with developing in Java (preferred)
or Python. No prior knowledge of Kafka is required.
