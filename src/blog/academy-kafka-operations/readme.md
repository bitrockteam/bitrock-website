In this three-day hands-on course you will learn how to build, manage, and monitor clusters using industry best-practices developed by the world’s foremost Apache Kafka experts.

You will learn how Kafka and the Confluent Platform work, their main subsystems, how they interact, and how to set up, manage, monitor, and tune your cluster.

### Hands-On Training

Throughout the course, hands-on exercises reinforce the topics being discussed. Exercises include:

* Cluster installation
* Basic cluster operations
* Viewing and interpreting cluster metrics
* Recovering from a Broker failure
* Performance-tuning the cluster
* Securing the cluster

### Who Should Attend?

This course is designed for engineers, system administrators, and operations staff responsible for building, managing, monitoring, and tuning Kafka clusters.

### Course Prerequisites

Attendees should have a strong knowledge of Linux/Unix, and understand basic TCP/IP networking concepts. Familiarity with the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is helpful. Prior knowledge of Kafka is helpful, but is not required.
