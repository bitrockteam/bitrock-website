**1) What does Front End mean to you today?**
Front-end development today means being able to think, design and deliver complex and reliable UIs. Companies today have high expectations on their application's frontend since it is the most understandable part from their user's perspective. It is also a job that needs a deep integration with many other departments (DevOps, back-end, marketing, etc... ) and requires the ability to establish or follow good cross-team workflows.

**2) Innovation or conservatism: which approach best represents your Unit?**
A mix of both, innovation is a key factor in the fron-tend landscape but is not sustainable to rewrite everything every 6 weeks, especially for customers. That's why we prefer to approach every project with a deep analysis first and then to elaborate a proposals based on common-sense and not on a "last-minute-hype".

**3) How do you see the future of the Front End? What will be the new challenges that we will have to expect?**
I think that in the near future the current Html/CSS/JS stack will be the only solution to develop user interfaces, no matter the platform... So front-end developers will be faced with many choices since they will be operating on very wide landscape. They will be able to switch between different contexts (like "classical" enterprise applications, gaming, VR, conversational interfaces, etc...) or to focus on one of them or a bit of both.

**4) What skills should a new member of your team have?**
It is crucial to learn "how to learn", given the exponential growth of Javascript and the front-end development landscape itself, you can't just sit on top of your previously acquired knowledge of the language, you have to keep learn what's new and sometimes adapt not only your technical knowledge, but also your mindset. So an open-minded asset is the most valuable skill to me.
