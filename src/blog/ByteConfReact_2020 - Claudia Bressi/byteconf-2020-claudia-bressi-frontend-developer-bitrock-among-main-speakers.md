Byteconf React is a 100% free conference with **the best React speakers and teachers in the world**.

The first edition was launched by **Bytesized Code** (whose mission is to innovate developer education online) in March of 2018. The conference, which represented a great resource for React developers of all experience levels, was streamed online on Twitch to over 900 people across the world.

Since then, the event has proved to be increasingly successful and highly appreciated by the audience, thanks to its ability to make the global dev community a small village and provide an awesome experience to everyone, in every corner of the world.

Bitrock was present during this yearâ€™s edition thanks to **Claudia Bressi**, brilliant Frontend Developer belonging to our Team, who was one of the official Speakers presenting her **React Bandersnatch experiment project**.

A great spotlight for Claudia and a source of pride for our whole frontend Team, whose expertise could be shared on one of the major stages for the global dev community.

The conference was streamed on YouTube, for free, so anyone and everyone could attend.
