Another great achievement for our DevOps Team: the possibility to take part in **HashiCorp EMEA Vault CHIP Virtual Bootcamp**.

The Bootcamp – coming for the first time to the EMEA region – involves the participation of high-skilled professionals that already have experience with Vault and want to get Vault CHIP (Certified HashiCorp Implementation Partner) certified for delivering on Vault Enterprise.

Our DevOps Team will be challenged with a series of highly technical tasks to demonstrate their expertise in the field. A 3 full-day training, that will get them ready to implement in a customer engagement.

This comes after the great success of last week, which saw our DevOps Team members Matteo Gazzetta, Michael Tabolsky, Gianluca Mascolo, Francesco Bartolini and Simone Ripamonti successfully obtaining **HashiCorp Certification as Vault Associate**. A source of pride for the Bitrock community and a remarkable recognition of our DevOps Team expertise and know-how worldwide.

With the Virtual Bootcamp, the Team is now ready to raise the bar and takes on a new challenge, proving that there’s no limit to self-improvement and continuous learning.

**May 5–May 8, 2020**
