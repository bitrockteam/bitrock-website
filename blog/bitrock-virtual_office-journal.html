Two months that have seen us deeply involved in many team-building activities to give the due importance to the human aspect of our worklife and reinforce our Team spirit during the long lockdown phase.</p> <p>Here’s the best highlights from our <strong>Bitrock Virtual_Office Journal</strong>: delve into its pages with us and get ready to turn back time…</p> <p><em>Friday, 10 April</em></p> <p>Our first virtual event is an open discussion about the world of <strong>Sport&amp;Wellbeing</strong>. What are Bitrockers fond of? Huge success for Martial arts and Oriental disciplines, followed by typical Winter sports (above all Skiing) and Water sports (Sailing is king here). But there’s appreciation for Meditation and Yoga, too!</p> <p><em>Tuesday, 14 April</em></p> <p>Another day, another event: this time we’re ready to talk about <strong>Movies&amp;TV Series</strong>: a very popular topic, especially during these months of lockdown. “What do you suggest me watching?” “Have you ever watched…?” – a passionate debate full of advice and reviews. The most loved TV series? The historical and science-fiction ones.</p> <p><em>Friday, 17 April</em></p> <p>Today’s event is dedicated to the lifetime passion of our Team members Marco and Mattia: <strong>BBQ</strong>. During an involving presentation, with a lot of information, examples and advice, they’re able to reveal us the secrets (or almost all of them) of the perfect BBQ. Now we can dream of our next real team-building bbq party!</p> <p><em>Tuesday, 21 April</em></p> <p>Today there’s a unique opportunity for the Team: listening to a fascinating introduction speech into the world of <strong>Mindfulness</strong>. Thanks to the knowledge and passion of Franco, we are ready to discover its main pillars and meditation practices: from its origins to the bonds with the Oriental culture, not forgetting a few examples of concrete activities and exercises, such as the awareness of breath, feelings, and thoughts. Mindfulness has proved to be a fascinating topic for the whole Team: we’re all eager to find out more!</p> <p><em>Friday, 24 April</em></p> <p>Our Virtual Office is changing into a bakery! Today Claudia will show us the best tricks and tips for pastry-making. The activity is not very simple, but brings also so much fun… Our mission? Cooking chocolate truffles. Each of us has their own ingredients and is ready to follow Claudia’s instructions on the screen, step by step. Huge success for our first <strong>Cooking Together</strong> event!</p> <p><em>Tuesday, 28 April</em></p> <p>Since in Bitrock we foster continuous learning and improving, here’s the perfect opportunity for us to expand our knowledge in many fields (history, science, literature and much more): a challenging <strong>general-knowledge Quiz</strong>! Two teams are fighting to conquer the title of “Smartest Team”. The final result? 10-10: all winners (and smarter)!</p> <p><em>Tuesday, 5 May</em></p> <p>Here we are, ready to travel around the world together (at least virtually). “<strong>Let’s Travel</strong>” is our new open-discussion event, during which we have the chance to talk about our past travel experiences, and our future journeys. The most fascinating destinations for the Team? The Far-East Countries (Thailand and Indonesia above all). But also several European cities seem to have stolen the heart of many of us: from Budapest to Prague, from Lisbon to Berlin.</p> <p><em>Friday, 8 May</em></p> <p>Today we have the chance to get closer to <strong>Calisthenics</strong>, a form of physical training focused on teaching you how to master your own bodyweight using minimal equipment. Thanks to the expertise of Erik, who has been practicing this sport for a few years now, we can discover many interesting aspects about it. For instance, that the word itself comes from the Greek: Kalos and Sthenos, meaning “Beauty” and “Strength”. Thanks to Erik’s presentation we can learn this discipline’s origins, benefits, and the main exercises that Calisthenics athletes can perform (such as the “human flag”!)</p> <p><em>Tuesday, 12 May</em></p> <p>Today’s virtual event is dedicated to reinforcing our “green” soul: here’s an open discussion about <strong>Eco&amp;Sustainability</strong> topics. Thanks to an online quiz game, we can test our knowledge regarding plastic pollution and learn many new facts and figures (for instance, that every year about 8 million tons of plastic waste escapes into the oceans from coastal nations). The event is also an opportunity to talk about possible remedies, such as improved waste management systems and recycling, a responsible use of disposable packaging and reduction in manufacturing of single-use plastics.</p> <p><em>Friday, 15 May</em></p> <p>Our Team has proved to be composed by talented chefs: here’s the second round of our “<strong>Cooking Together”</strong> event! Following Claudia’s precise instructions, we are ready to prepare our first double-chocolate cheesecakes. The event turns out into an unforgettable experience: there’s always time for fun and laughter beyond ingredients and kitchen tools!</p> <p><em>Tuesday, 19 May</em></p> <p>The <strong>English language</strong> plays a crucial role in our international Team. That’s why we decided to dedicate one of our events to improve our language skills. How? With fun, of course: thanks to entertaining videos and an online Pub Quiz game, we can work on our pronunciation and fluency. The one and only rule for this event? Italian banned - English only!</p> <p><em>Friday, 21 May</em></p> <p>Today we have the opportunity to listen again to Franco’s <strong>Mindfulness</strong> presentation. Having already explored its basics during last month’s event, this time we raise the bar and start discovering a few mindful practices that we can put into practice in our daily life – especially during these months of smart working, during which a responsible and focused attitude is required. The main lesson we have learnt from today? “The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second-best time is now” (Chinese proverb).</p> <p>So, here we are now, full of good memories about events that have been able to cheer us up during the lockdown months.</p> <p>What other opportunities will the Virtual Office offer us? The virtual room is still open and eager to welcome new voices and new faces… New events #comingsoon!</p></div></div></section></article></main> <footer id="corporate" class="corporate"><div class="wrapper"><article><div><h4>Corporate</h4> <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/bitrock-srl/jobs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Careers</a> <br> <a href="https://databiz.it/#philosophy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Group philosophy</a> <br> <a href="https://www.iubenda.com/privacy-policy/81384922" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Privacy policy</a></p></div> <div><h4>Treviso</h4> <p>
